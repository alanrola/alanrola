**Infrastructure Automation | Senior Systems Engineer | IT Optimization & Scalability**

Linux & automation. Ansible. Sharing simple, reusable playbooks/roles.

---

## What I build
- Clear, documented **Ansible playbooks** and **roles** (RHEL 8/9)
- Small, practical examples focused on **idempotence** and **readability**
- Community-first: everything is meant to be easy to learn and reuse

## Highlights
- ðŸ§° **Ansible Cookbook** â†’ reusable examples: [ansible-cookbook](https://github.com/alanrola/ansible-cookbook)
- ðŸ§© Roles (docs inside each folder):
  - manage-packages â€¢ install_node_exporter â€¢ kill-processes-zombie
  - root-command-log â€¢ create-user â€¢ disable-account

## Tech
`Ansible` Â· `RHEL 8/9` Â· `systemd` Â· `Bash` Â· `Kubernetes (k8s)` Â· `Linux`

## How to use my repos
- Read the README at the repo root
- Check `playbooks/README.md` and `roles/README.md` for quick run examples
- Open an issue if somethingâ€™s unclear â€” Iâ€™m learning in public
